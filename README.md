The WEAP Calibration and Ensemble with R tool serves to provide model builders with an automatic tool to assist in calibrating a WEAP model and/or run a WEAP ensemble.

if you run "ScriptWEAPKeyGaugeBranches.vbs" in your WEAP area you will get "WEAPKeyGaugeBranches.csv" within the folder "WEAPKeyGaugeBranches" created in your WEAP area folder.
