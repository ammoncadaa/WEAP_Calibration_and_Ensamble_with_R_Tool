The WEAP Calibration and Ensemble with R tool serves to provide model builders with an automatic tool to assist in calibrating a WEAP model and/or run a WEAP ensemble.

if you run "ScriptWEAPKeyGaugeBranches.vbs" in your WEAP area, you will get "WEAPKeyGaugeBranches.csv" within the created folder "WEAPKeyGaugeBranches" in your WEAP area folder.
